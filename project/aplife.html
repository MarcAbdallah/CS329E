                                    <p id="explanation">According to National Geographic, plant life is greatly affected by climate change. To start, with the increase in CO2 levels, plants do not need as much water to perform photosynthesis. Initially, it was thought that this would lead to a rise in fresh water. However, hotter temperatures means longer and warmer growing seasons which, in turn, allows plants to consume more water and therefore, dry out the land. So, though plants have the potential to grow with higher CO2 levels, it will lead to drought for the land and people. </p></div>

A warming environment is causing a steady melting of the permafrost, and spurs the growth of new shrubs which can prevent snow from properly reflecting heat. Air pollution is also greatly affecting the tundra area. Black carbon from diesel engines and fires settles on the snow which further prevents the landscape from reflecting heat. Climate change is also driving invasive species further north, hurting the species native to the region.</div></div></td>

The increase in the summer period also poses a threat from wildfires. In the western mountain forests, the length of the fire season has increased by at least a month since 1979. The melting of glaciers within the mountain regions also presents a serious threat to the wildlife and plants there as it changes the flow of the rivers within the mountains and causes an increase in rockslides, avalanches and mountain floods. </div></div></td>

All of these factors can impact the species living within the region as they can cause a species to shift their range or die out completely. Insect outbreaks often directly weaken and harm trees which can destroy the livelihood of a forest. Wildfires are becoming much more common with the rising temperatures and have consumed over 8 million acres of forest within the US alone. The rise in natural disasters such as hurricanes, ice and wind storms also greatly harm forest regions.</div></div></td>

This prevents many sea creatures such as coral and mollusks from forming their protective shells. The rising sea temperatures causes fish populations to migrate to cooler regions which disrupts a variety of different ecosystems within the ocean as predators and prey both struggle to find new sources of food. The bleaching of coral reefs is intensifying at a rapid rate as these animals are reliant on a form of algae that is steadily abandoning the reefs due to the increase in heat and acidity. </div></div></td>
