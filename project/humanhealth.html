There is expected to be 20-30 more days over 90 degrees F in most areas within the century, according to the National Climate Assessment. Within the last decade, daily record high temperatures have happened about twice as often as record lows - a stark increase from the 1950’s where the record highs and lows were about equal.</div>

Warmer ocean temperatures and the rising of sea levels is causing tropical storms to intensify greatly and to increase their negative impacts. This means that hurricanes are more likely to cause significantly worse damage and higher death rates if no action is taken.</div>

The number of wildfires within the western United States has doubled between 1984 and 2015. An average annual increase of 1 degree C would cause the median burned area per year to increase by as much as 600 percent in certain regions.</div>

                                <div class="text">The rising temperature of the atmosphere increases the atmosphere’s ability to hold, and in turn, distribute more water. Within the Northeast US alone, extreme storms generate about 27 percent more moisture than they did 100 years ago. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration concluded that current rains are at least 40 percent more likely to occur and 10 percent more intense due to factors affecting climate change.</div>
