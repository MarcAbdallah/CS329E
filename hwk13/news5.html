    <h2>Lakers Fans Proposing Increasingly Ridiculous Trades, Many Others Unsure If They Know What A Salary Cap Is</h2>
    <p>"It's simple, really. Just trade Kuzma for Damian Lillard, KCP for Buddy Hield, and then do a sign and trade for Demar Derozan",
        said a Lakers fan in preparation for the upcoming NBA offseason. After being asked how the Lakers could
        afford such moves, the fan rubbed his head in silence, before saying "as long as we keep Caruso, we'll be fine".
